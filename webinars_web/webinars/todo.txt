re-implement csrf
do something with webinar events that linger on our system, but have been deleted remotely -- either have them automatically "archived", or have them shown as having lost their connection somehow
remove all ".all()" model calls-- that should never really be used!
account validation and sync on news/edits
need to clean house on all utc/timezone bullshit
need to deal much better with our true form<->page -- showing just unique forms, and then maybe a listing of landing pages that use those forms

fix pywebex to get rid of redundant naming (delete_event, create_event all under event controller)



events
======
webex <=> local

    full events sync:
        pull all webex_events
        pull all local_events
        insert local_event where webex_event doesn't exist locally
        delete local_event where local_event doesn't exist remotely and it's been previously synced
        insert webex_event where local_event doesn't exist remotely (only for future events)
        for those that exist in both:
            if updated_at > last_synced_at:
                update remote with local
            else
                update local with remote

    single event sync: follow same methods

leads (for a single event)
=====
webex <=> local

    full leads sync:
        pull all webex_leads
        pull all local_leads
        insert local_leads where webex_lead doesn't exist locally
        delete local_leads where local_lead doesn't exist remotely and it's been previously synced
        insert webex_leads where local_lead doesn't exist remotely (only for future events)
        for those that exist in both:
            if updated_at > last_synced_with_webinar_at:
                update remote with local
            else
                update local with remote

    full leads sync:
        pull all hubspot_leads
        pull all local_leads

        insert hubspot_leads where local_lead doesn't exist remotely
        for those that exist in both:
            if updated_at > last_synced_with_hubspot_at:
                update remote with local
            else
                update local with remote
